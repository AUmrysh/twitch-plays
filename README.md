Twitch Plays
============

Clone of [Twitch Plays Pokemon](http://twitch.tv/twitch_plays_pokemon).

Included in `vba/` is the VBA .ini I've been using. 

In your VBA/Emulator, set the controls to the following -

```
Up: 0
Down: 1
Left: 2
Right: 3
Button A: 4
Button B: 5
Start: 6
Select: 7
```

If you have any question, feel free to [message me on Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/message/compose?to=aidraj_) or send an email to `aidraj0 at gmail dot com`.

You'll need to have VBA in focus for this to work, so your best bet would be to run all of this
from within a VM.
